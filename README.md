# Hi there, I'm Aditya! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first year* Computer Science and Mathematics student at LSU! I'm passionate about **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**, and also **Web Applications** and **Software Engineering** as a side hobby.

I've experienced working with independent AI/ML research and programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java. I'm currently looking for internship/research opportunities and other ways to get involved with hands-on projects.

<small>*i'm doing the computer science major first, then getting started with the math!</small>
